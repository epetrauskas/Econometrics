Reading data uses connections which can be local files, remote files accessed via http, pipes from other programs or more.

As a simple example, consider this access for N=10 random integers between min=100 and max=200 from random.org (which supplies true random numbers based on atmospheric noise rather than a pseudo random number generator):

```{r eval = FALSE}

site <- "http://random.org/integers/"         # base URL
query <- "num=10&min=100&max=200&col=2&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new"
txt <- paste(site, query, sep="?")            # concat url and query string
nums <- read.table(file=txt)                  # and read the data
nums                                          # and show it

```
